# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/omines/datatables-bundle/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
